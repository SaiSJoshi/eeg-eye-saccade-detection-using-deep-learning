# Abstract
</br>
</br>
Eye-tracking technologies are of great importance in various fields including diagnosis and behavioral sciences. As a non-invasive and low-cost measure of brain dynamics, electroencephalography (EEG) provides both research and application value in eye-tracking recognition. The objective of our project is to create one unified model to get all the information of the saccade from datasets which only have partial information. To the greatest extent possible, we have achieved comparable results of accuracy on all tasks as implemented in the literature. We have extended the work to implement multitask classification using pseudo-label generation. We obtained 92.88% accuracy for left/right classification, mean squared error(RMSE) of 27.29 mm for Amplitude, 0.98 rad for Angle, and Euclidean distance of 54.45 mm for the absolute position. Some of the results beat the baseline performance using one single model. The next step is to update the pseudo labels and quantify the weights based on probability. Future work will focus on hyperparameters tuning, reducing noisy labels, and evaluating options for multitasking paradigms.
